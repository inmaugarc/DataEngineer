## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are some libraries that you need to install to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
Those libraries are detailed in the requierements.txt file, so be sure that you meet all the requirements (by installing them with 'pip3 install requirements.txt').
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* but if you find errors, please contact me.
Be the force with you!

## How To <a name="howto"></a>

To run the scripts simply execute:
python create_tables.py
python etl.py

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a> 

There is a startup named Sparkify that wants to analyze the data they have been collecting about the songs and other user activity on their new music streaming app. They want to answer to the following question:

> * Question 1: What are the songs that users are listening to?


They don't have an easy way to query their data that is stored in a directory of JSON files with the logs on user activity on the app. They have also a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The goal of this project are:
> * Creating a Postgress database with tables specifically designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. 
> * Create a database schema, defining fact and dimension tables for a star schema
> * Design and implement the ETL pipeline for the analysis. This pipeline transfers data from files in two directories into some tables in Postgress
> * Use Python and SQL



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions previously presented. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the analysis process for individual steps.

There are 3 folders, one for year (2020, 2019 and 2018) containing each one a zip file with two files (I had to upload them zipped as they exceed the maximum file limits of Github): 

> * Song Dataset       - This dataset is a subset of the Million Song Dataset () and each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each songs 's track. 
> * Log Dataset        - This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the previous dataset. That is to simulate activity logs of users of a music streaming app.


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity for collecting data and because there are some pieces of code taken out from the Data Engineer Nanodegree classrooms.
